## Introduction and Review of the Citizen's Guide (2min)

Greetings. Thank you all for being here today; we hope you are finding this panel informative. I'm Curtis, this is Dawn, and today we'd like to tell you about our experience writing a Citizen's Guide to Open Data, and how it has influenced out view of the value of open data for civil society.

We'll start by going over the CGOD and what we were thinking about when we scoped it and started writing, before we go onto a critical analysis not only of our own work, but how we saw a need to reevaluate our own understandings and approaches to Open Data as citizens.

We wrote the citizen's guide with a number of objectives in mind beyond increasing our own understanding of the place of Open Data in society. First of all, we wanted to create a guide that served as an entry level guide to understanding Open Data in a social as well as operational context- we wanted to increase conceptual literacy as well as technical literacy. We found many examples of guides that provided a technical entry point for would be citizen-data-scientists, but not for the av erage citizen to gain an rounded and critical understanding of the value of Open Data. This is why we also wanted to use the Citizen's Guide to research and share stories and examples of Open Data being usd for the social good, as well as cases where the values of open data could be questioned.

If you follow the shortened link we posted, you can see how we organized the Citizen's Guide in an attempt to be broad, yet somewhat robust. We are still working on the project though, and appreciate comments, suggestions, and criticisms. Because of some of the observations we have made, we'd  like to take the Citizen's Guide to a more critical place and to situate it within other data-driven and computation/culture debates within our societies.

## Reorientation of a Civil Society Perspective 

On this panel, we're supposed to be representing the perspective of civil society. Presumably, that means that we're supposed to be talking for and about groups that work with or outside of government to accomplish goals that increase ideological goals (usually democratic), or increase the presumed stock of public goods. 

As we've researched, we've come to an undertstanding that there is no unified civil society perspective, because aims and goals are always contested, and issues are never clearcut. We've moved away from the Habermasian understanding of a public sphere of rational, liberal discourse on 'what ought to be done' to a view espoused by thinkers following John Dewey like Chris Dantec and Carl DiSalvo that publics are uneven, plural, agonistic and issues based groups of people who share a stake in some matter of civil concern (Dantec, 2013). We wanted to ask ourselves what sort of publics are arising around open data, and what issues they serve. 

Prima facie, there is a worry that OD will be used as a tool for those who already have the skills to access, understand, and put it to task. In this case, OD might largely be used to serve the needs of technically saavy, middle class urbanites. As we found, many data sets are opened by priority of request- so those that already know what to do would have the initiative. Communities who are underserved or marginalized in other ways are perhaps also more likely to lack the skills necessary to mobilize for political action, much less to use Open Data for those ends. 

Even for those who do use Open Data to advance their public causes, it is worth inquiring about the value of many of their solutions. In some cases, projects have been very successful in using Open Data and design to 'reveal hegemony' (DiSalvo, 2014 [adversarial])- but how does making injustice more explicit with Open Data do anything to shatter the power relations that perpetuate oppression? Some value might come from hackathons and short-term application development runs for public good, but if it is primarily networking and quasi-educational, do we need to look for better models for using open data and technology in service of publics that are not already included in open data civil society?
