## Introduction and Review of the Citizen's Guide (2min)

Greetings. Thank you all for being here today; we hope you will find this panel informative. I'm Curtis, this is Dawn, and today we'd like to tell you about our experience writing a Citizen's Guide to Open Data, and how it has influenced out view on the value of open data for civil society.

[SLIDE]

We'll start by going over the CGOD and what we were thinking about when we scoped it and started writing, before we go onto a critical analysis not only of our own work, but how we saw a need to reevaluate our own understandings and approaches to Open Data as citizens.

[SLIDE]

We wrote the citizen's guide with a number of objectives in mind beyond increasing our own understanding of the place of Open Data in society. First of all, we wanted to create a guide that served as an entry level to understanding Open Data in a social as well as operational context- we wanted to increase conceptual literacy as well as technical literacy. We found many examples of guides that provided a technical entry point for would be citizen-data-scientists, but not for the average citizen to gain a rounded and critical understanding of the value of Open Data. This is why we also wanted to use the Citizen's Guide to research and share stories and examples of Open Data being used for the social good, as well as cases where the values of open data could be questioned.

If you follow the shortened link we posted, you can see how we organized the Citizen's Guide in an attempt to be broad, yet somewhat robust. We are still working on the project though, and appreciate comments, suggestions, and criticisms. Because of some of the observations we have made, future steps would situate the Citizen's Guide to a more critical place and within other data-driven and computation/culture debates within our societies. 

## Reflections and Takeaways on Value (2min)

Based on the process of writing the citizen's guide, we have a few reflections and takeaways on value, related to the theme of this panel, that I will mention today:

- first in writing the guide we had to asses who would make use of the guide an further what would count as valuable

- emergent value as _(potential value of open data)_...
    - "access" (having channels)
    - "recognition" (seeing importance)
    - "ability" (making use)
    - "criticality" (understanding and assessing)

- Looking at how value is discussed elsewhere you see similar themes. From Open Data Institute the terms "improvements, accessing, understanding, jobs, discovery" (Open Data Institute, n.d.) From a McKinsey Report the terms "economic, enhances impact, business opportunities, consumer benefit" (Manyika et al., 2013)
    - However the language and orientation feels significantly different when taken from a more civil society oriented perspective

- _Connections, or lack thereof,_ of people who could benefit and people with expertise

- _Space or site of 'inbetween'_ that open data occupies: government activities and intentions, citizens and their representation

## Reorientation of a Civil Society Perspective 

On this panel, we're supposed to be representing the perspective of civil society. Presumably, that means that we're supposed to be talking for and about groups that work with or outside of government to accomplish tasks that advance ideological goals (usually democratic), or increase the presumed stock of public goods. 

As we've researched, we've come to an undertstanding that there is no unified civil society perspective, because aims and goals are always contested, and issues are never clearcut. We've moved away from the Habermasian understanding of a public sphere of rational, liberal discourse on 'what ought to be done' to a view espoused by thinkers following John Dewey like Chris Dantec and Carl DiSalvo that publics are uneven, plural, agonistic and issues based groups of people who share a stake in some matter of civil concern (Dantec, 2013). We wanted to ask ourselves what sort of publics are arising around open data, and what issues they serve. 

Prima facie, there is a worry that OD will be used as a tool for those who already have the skills to access, understand, and put it to task. In this case, OD might largely be used to serve the needs of technically saavy, middle class urbanites. As we found, many data sets are opened by priority of request- so those that already know what to do would have the initiative. Communities who are underserved or marginalized in other ways are perhaps also more likely to lack the skills necessary to mobilize for political action, much less to use Open Data for those ends. 

Perhaps the most glaring issue that comes up when writing a Citizen's Guide to Open Data is not the elucidation of Open Data concepts, but the implictly normative understanding of the Citizen. What are the threads that tie citizens together, and get them to work with each other? Can we rely on the neoliberal citizen, who is focussed on maximizing convenience and reducing interpersonal friction in market transactions through the use special tools? Or do we have to fall back onto older, (still liberal) concepts of civic-minded nationalism?

Even for those who do use Open Data to advance public causes, it is worth inquiring about the perspective of many of their solutions. Using Open Data is often, but not always, based on quantatative data. But how well do statistics capture the realities of situations, how can more qualitative data, such as oral histories be incorporated into this work? 

In some cases, social and data justice projects have been very successful in using Open Data and design to 'reveal hegemony' (DiSalvo, 2014)- but how does making injustice more explicit with Open Data do anything to shatter the power relations that perpetuate oppression? Some value might come from hackathons and hypothetical pitches, but is it primarily accrued to those involved- through networking and professional development? If so, do we need to look for better models for using open data and technology in service of publics that are not already included in open data civil society?

When considering the perspective and attitude of the citizen, we must also consider its antipode- the state. How do governments bear responsibilities in the ongoing development of OD projects? If they openly support citizen lead initatives using Open Data, then what responsibility to accept the outcomes, provide resources, and cede power could arise? Is it enough for the government to leave citizens in the sphere of civil society, or is it possible to channel that effort into democratic policy making and legislation?


## Revaluation of Open Data (4min)

- Acknowledgement of heterogeneity. Publics are constructed based on the provision of infrastructures (Dantec, 2013)

- Resist equivocations of datafication with democracy (Powell, 2015)

- Engagement and Mobilization. Participation to redress (Seiber and Johnson, 2015) rather than reinforce existing powerful groups
