## Introduction and Review of the Citizen's Guide (2min)

Greetings. Thank you all for being here today; we hope you will find this panel informative. I'm Curtis, this is Dawn, and today we'd like to tell you about our experience writing a Citizen's Guide to Open Data, and how it has influenced out view on the value of open data for civil society.

We'll start by going over the CGOD and what we were thinking about when we scoped it and started writing, before we go onto a critical analysis not only of our own work, but how we saw a need to reevaluate our own understandings and approaches to Open Data as citizens.

[SLIDE]

We wrote the citizen's guide with a number of objectives in mind beyond increasing our own understanding of the place of Open Data in society. First of all, we wanted to create a guide that served as an entry level to understanding Open Data in a social as well as operational context- we wanted to increase conceptual literacy as well as technical literacy. We found many examples of guides that provided a technical entry point for would be citizen-data-scientists, but not for the average citizen to gain a rounded and critical understanding of the value of Open Data. This is why we also wanted to use the Citizen's Guide to research and share stories and examples of Open Data being used for the social good, as well as cases where the values of open data could be questioned.

If you follow the shortened link we posted, you can see how we organized the Citizen's Guide in an attempt to be broad, yet somewhat robust. We are still working on the project though, and appreciate comments, suggestions, and criticisms. Because of some of the observations we have made, future steps would situate the Citizen's Guide to a more critical place and within other data-driven and computation/culture debates within our societies.

## Reflections and Takeaways on Value (2min)

As Curtis mentioned, the process of writing the citizen's guide provided us the opportunity to reflect. From this we have some takeaways on what the concept of 'value,' means for civil society and open data.

But first, it might help to tease out the two ways we can use the term value: not only does value refer to the measure of a worth of a thing, in an instrumental or economic sense, it can also can be used to consider the degree of importance, in a much more normative or ethical sense.

- In writing the guide we had to asses who would make use of it and act as our primary audience, further what would count as valuable to them. Given its name _Citizen's Guide_ the primary audience should be relatively apparent, and Curtis will shortly speak more to ways that citizenship could perhaps influence how we understand value.

- From this anchor of citizen's as our audience, and the frame we applied while writing, _the emerging potential value of open data became couched in themes of_...
    - "access" (open data providing citizens with channels)
    - "recognition" (open data creating a lense for citizens to see what is important)
    - "ability" (open data generating ways to make use of information)
    - "criticality" (open data building approaches to understanding)

- Looking at how value is discussed from other perspectives you see not too disimilar terms, for instance:
    - Open Data Institute uses the terms "improvements, accessing, understanding, discovery" (Open Data Institute, n.d.)
    - McKinsey uses the terms "economic access, enhances impact, business opportunities, consumer benefit" (Manyika et al., 2013)

- However, I want to pause and make the case that the language and orientation could be meaningfully different if rooted within a participatory, justice-based conception of information. _Access_ becomes redistributive rather than entry into a market, beyond understanding and discovery; recognition and criticality push for deeper literacies and fluency...

- Next, the guide and the process of creation served to surface where there are, or should be, _connections and links_ between people who could benefit from open data and the people with that opden data expertise

- Finally, we wondered if instead of just looking at the 'open data' itself, there is something of potential in viewing open data's value as creating the _'inbetweens'_ or contested spaces through the processes of opening data:
    - Whether that inbetween manifests in the discrepancies in government activities and their intentions around accountability
    - Or instead in the midst of everyday citizen concerns and their representation in policy making

## Reorientation of a Civil Society Perspective

On this panel, we're supposed to be representing the perspective of civil society. Presumably, that means that we're supposed to be talking for and about groups that work with or outside of government to accomplish tasks that advance ideological goals (usually democratic), or increase the presumed stock of public goods.

As we've researched, we've come to an undertstanding that there is no unified civil society perspective, because aims and goals are always contested, and issues are never clearcut. We've moved away from the Habermasian understanding of a public sphere of rational, liberal discourse on 'what ought to be done' to a view espoused by thinkers following John Dewey like Chris Dantec and Carl DiSalvo that publics are uneven, plural, agonistic and issues based groups of people who share a stake in some matter of civil concern (Dantec, 2013). We wanted to ask ourselves what sort of publics are arising around open data, and what issues they serve.

Perhaps the most glaring issue that comes up when writing a Citizen's Guide to Open Data is not the elucidation of Open Data concepts, but the implictly normative understanding of the Citizen. What are the threads that tie citizens together, and get them to work with each other? Can we rely on the neoliberal citizen, who is focussed on maximizing convenience and reducing interpersonal friction in market transactions through the use special tools? Or do we have to fall back onto older, (still liberal) concepts of civic-minded nationalism?

[SLIDE]

Even for those who do use Open Data to advance public causes, it is worth inquiring about the perspective of many of their solutions. Using Open Data is often, but not always, based on quantatative data. But how well do statistics capture the realities of situations?  Anti-eviction mapping uses open data in combination with local histories to create a living document about the changes happening in San Francisco. How can we addincorporate more qualitative data, such as oral histories and storytelling to our OD supported narratives?

[SLIDE]

In some cases, social and data justice projects have been very successful in using Open Data and design to 'reveal hegemony' (DiSalvo, 2014)- but how does making injustice more explicit with Open Data do anything to shatter the power relations that perpetuate oppression? Some value might come from hackathons and hypothetical pitches, but is it primarily accrued to those involved- through networking and professional development? Eyal Wizeman uses open geospatial data, as well as CCTV footage and forensic techniques to track and assess drones strikes, and prepare evidence that will be used in court to persecute war criminals. Another Project in Chicago has forced their Police force to release data that has been used show patterns in officer complaints and discipline that shows some of the worst police offenders are getting off without discipline.

[SLIDE]

We need to look for better models for using open data and technology in service of publics that are not already included in open data civil society. This means getting our of our comfort zones. Civic Tech Toronto happens downtown- not in Rexdale or Moss Park. Will OD be used as a tool for those who already have the skills to access, understand, and put it to task. In this case, OD might largely be used to serve the needs of technically saavy, middle class urbanites. As we found, many data sets are opened by priority of request- so those that already know what to do would have the initiative. Communities who are underserved or marginalized in other ways are perhaps also more likely to lack the skills necessary to mobilize for political action, much less to use Open Data for those ends. The Detroit Digital Justice coalition is reaching out to communities who lack these skills and networks, with their Digital Justice Zine, and through cooperation with organizations like the Allied Media Coalition. These organizations are explictly inclusive and focussed on social justice through data and technology.

[SLIDE]

When considering the perspective and attitude of the citizen, we must also consider the role of the state. How do governments bear responsibilities in the ongoing development of OD projects? If they openly support citizen lead initatives using Open Data, then what responsibility to accept the outcomes, provide resources, and cede power could arise? Is it enough for the government to leave citizens in the sphere of civil society, or is it possible to channel that effort into democratic policy making and legislation?


## Revaluation of Open Data (4min)

Finally we wanted to end with some small thoughts on ways forward for our understanding of 'value' from a civil society perspective.

If, as Kranzberg's first law of technology, albeit slightly tailored, articulates "[data] is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral" I think we have a responsibility to continually challenge ourselves and develop strategies that push us toward better outcomes:

- First we are hoping for a greater **acknowledgement of the heterogeneity within civil society**. As Curtis mentioned, using the concept of **publics** is maybe one way to open space within currently undifferentiated understanding of citizens. Work on Big Data's impact on marginalized communities by Waddell and many scholars at Data & Society serve to emphasize the uneven structure of our civil society.
    - Further, if as Le Dantec and DiSalvo argue, infrastructures contribute to the construction of these publics, more attendance could be taken to how they are designed.
    - In human computer interaction, the term "transparent" is used to refer to the invisibility of components of a system to users (like looking through a mirror)-- or the degree to which a user 'doesn't notice.'
    - The opposite, opacity in the context of infrastructures might include data that remains attributable, sources that aren't lost.

- Second, more work needs to be to resist equivocations of datafication with democracy (Powell, 2015). If we rely on open data alone to drive greater democracy, or give the appearance of such in our conversations, we are limiting our ability to assess whether we have fully understood the tradeoffs of relying on quantified experience and if we've avoided collapsing those two concepts together

- Third, further thinking of engagement and mobilization. Open data understood as a path for governments to interact with citizens (Seiber and Johnson, 2015), using participation to redress rather than reinforce existing powerful groups.

So, with all of this, we have been left asking ourselves how do we as open data researchers, but also representatives of civil society, challenge ourselves to keep these considerations visible, to work with friction, and demand technologies remain opaque.
