# Presentation notes for Dawn

"the regard that something is held to deserve; the importance, worth, or usefulness of something."
"a person's principles or standards of behavior; one's judgment of what is important in life."
"consider (someone or something) to be important or beneficial; have a high opinion of."

## Reflections and Takeaways on Value (2min)

Based on the process of writing the citizen's guide, we have a few reflections and takeaways on value, related to the theme of this panel, that I will mention today:

- first in writing the guide we had to asses who would make use of the guide an further what would count as valuable

- emergent value as _(potential value of open data)_...
    - "access" (having channels)
    - "recognition" (seeing importance)
    - "ability" (making use)
    - "criticality" (understanding and assessing)

- Looking at how value is discussed elsewhere you see similar themes. From Open Data Institute the terms "improvements, accessing, understanding, jobs, discovery" (Open Data Institute, n.d.) From a McKinsey Report the terms "economic, enhances impact, business opportunities, consumer benefit" (Manyika et al., 2013)
    - However the language and orientation feels significantly different when taken from a more civil society oriented perspective

- _Connections, or lack thereof,_ of people who could benefit and people with expertise

- _Space or site of 'inbetween'_ that open data occupies: government activities and intentions, citizens and their representation

## Revaluation of Open Data (4min)

- Acknowledgement of heterogeneity. Publics are constructed based on the provision of infrastructures (Dantec, 2013)

- Resist equivocations of datafication with democracy (Powell, 2015)

- Engagement and Mobilization. Participation to redress (Seiber and Johnson, 2015) rather than reinforce existing powerful groups
